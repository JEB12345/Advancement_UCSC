@article{2917079,
	Abstract = {Embodiment has led to a revolution in robotics by not thinking of
	the robot body and its controller as two separate units, but by taking
	into account the interaction of the body with its environment. By
	investigating the impact of the body on the overall control-computation,
	it has been suggested that the body is effectively performing computations,
	leading to the term Morphological Computation. Recent work has linked
	this to the field of Reservoir Computing, allowing to endow morphologies
	with a theory of universal computation. In this work, we study a
	family of highly dynamic body structures, specifically tensegrity
	structures, controlled by one of the simplest kinds of "brains".
	These structures can be used to model biomechanical systems at different
	scales. By analyzing this extreme instantiation of compliant structures,
	we demonstrate the existence of a spectrum of choices on how to implement
	control in the body-brain composite. We show that tensegrity structures
	can maintain complex gaits with linear feedback control and that
	external feedback can intrinsically be integrated in the control
	loop. The various linear learning rules we consider, differ in biological
	plausibility and no specific assumptions are made on how to implement
	the feedback in a physical system.},
