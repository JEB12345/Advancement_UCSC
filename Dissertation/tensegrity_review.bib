	Abstract = {To better understand the role of tensegrity
                   structures in biological systems and their
                   application to robotics, the Dynamic Tensegrity
                   Robotics Lab at {NASA} Ames Research Center, Moffett
                   Field, {CA}, {USA}, has developed and validated two
                   software environments for the analysis, simulation
                   and design of tensegrity robots. These tools, along
                   with new control methodologies and the modular
                   hardware components developed to validate them, are
                   presented as a system for the design of actuated
                   tensegrity structures. As evidenced from their
                   appearance in many biological systems, tensegrity
                   ('tensileÂ¿integrity') structures have unique
                   physical properties that make them ideal for
                   interaction with uncertain environments. Yet, these
                   characteristics make design and control of
                   bioinspired tensegrity robots extremely challenging.
                   This work presents the progress our tools have made
                   in tackling the design and control challenges of
                   spherical tensegrity structures. We focus on this
                   shape since it lends itself to rolling locomotion.
                   The results of our analyses include multiple novel
                   control approaches for mobility and terrain
                   interaction of spherical tensegrity structures that
                   have been tested in simulation. A hardware prototype
                   of a spherical six-bar tensegrity, the Reservoir
                   Compliant Tensegrity Robot, is used to empirically
                   validate the accuracy of simulation.},

	Abstract = {Most active structures involve direct control of
                   single parameters when there is a closed form
                   relationship between the response required and the
                   control parameter. Building on a previous study of an
                   adjustable structure, this paper describes geometric
                   active control of a reusable tensegrity structure
                   that has been enlarged to five modules with improved
                   connections and is equipped with actuators. Closely
                   coupled strut and cable elements behave nonlinearly
                   (geometrically) even for small movement of the 10
                   telescopic struts. The control criterion for
                   maintaining the upper surface slope has no closed
                   form relationship with strut movement. The behavior
                   of the structure is studied under 25 load cases. A
                   newly developed stochastic search algorithm
                   successfully identifies good control commands
                   following computation times of up to 1 h. Sequential
                   application of the commands through sets of partial
                   commands helps to avoid exceeding limits during
                   intermediate stages and adds robustness to the
                   system. Reuse of a previously calculated command
                   reduces the response time to less than 1 min.
                   Feasible storage and reuse of such commands confirm
                   the potential for improving performance during
                   service.},

@article{Hauser,
	Abstract = {The control of compliant robots is, due to their
                   often nonlinear and complex dynamics, inherently
                   difficult. The vision of morphological computation
                   proposes to view these aspects not only as problems,
                   but rather also as parts of the solution. Non-rigid
                   body parts are not seen anymore as imperfect
                   realizations of rigid body parts, but rather as
                   potential computational resources. The applicability
                   of this vision has already been demonstrated for a
                   variety of complex robot control problems.
                   Nevertheless, a theoretical basis for understanding
                   the capabilities and limitations of morphological
                   computation has been missing so far. We present a
                   model for morphological computation with compliant
                   bodies, where a precise mathematical characterization
                   of the potential computational contribution of a
                   complex physical body is feasible. The theory
                   suggests that complexity and nonlinearity, typically
                   unwanted properties of robots, are desired features
                   in order to provide computational power. We
                   demonstrate that simple generic models of physical
                   bodies, based on mass-spring systems, can be used to
                   implement complex nonlinear operators. By adding a
                   simple readout (which is static and linear) to the
                   morphology such devices are able to emulate complex
                   mappings of input to output streams in continuous
                   time. Hence, by outsourcing parts of the computation
                   to the physical body, the difficult problem of
                   learning to control a complex body, could be reduced
                   to a simple and perspicuous learning task, which can
                   not get stuck in local minima of an error function.},

@inproceedings{Skelton1997Controllable-Te,
	Abstract = {Tensegrity structures represent a special class of
                   tendon space structures, whose members may
                   simultaneously perform the functions of strength,
                   sensing, actuating and feedback control. Thus, these
                   structures ideally match the definition of smart
                   structures. This paper introduces the concept of
                   controllable tensegrity as a new class of smart
                   structures capable of large displacement. The
                   kinematics and nonlinear dynamics of one element of
                   this class is derived and analyzed. Pre-stressability
                   conditions are given and a particular equilibrium
                   identified. The equations of motion are then
                   linearized about this equilibrium and linear
                   parametric models generated. These are next used for
                   controller design. For control system design some of
                   the tendons are chosen as actuators and some as
                   sensors and a family of dynamic controllers designed
                   such that the control energy is minimized while
                   requiring output variance constraints to be
                   satisfied. Another family of controllers is designed
                   such that the output variance is minimized while
                   requiring input variance constraints to be satisfied.
                   The performances of these controllers are evaluated.},

                   sampling-based motion planners, such as RRT*, that
                   asymptotically converge to optimal solutions. The
                   basic variant of such methods requires a local
                   planner, which connects two states with a trajectory.
                   For systems with dynamics, the local planner needs to
                   solve a two-point boundary value problem (BVP) for
                   differential equations. Such a solver is not always
                   available for state update equations of interesting
                   systems with dynamics. Furthermore, asymptotically
                   optimal solutions tend to impose increased
                   computational requirements in practice relative to
                   alternatives, such as RRT, that focus on feasibility,
                   state-space exploration speed and which do not
                   require a local planner. This paper describes a
                   sampling-based motion planning solution with the
                   following desirable properties: a) it does not
                   require a BVP solver but only uses a forward
                   propagation model, b) it employs a single propagation
                   per iteration similar to RRT, making it very
                   efficient, c) it is asymptotically near-optimal, and
                   d) provides a sparse data structure for answering
                   path queries, which further improves computational
                   performance. Simulations on prototypical dynamical
                   systems show the method is able to improve the
                   quality of feasible solutions over time and that it
                   is computationally efficient.},

@article{Ijspeert2008,
	Abstract = {The problem of controlling locomotion is an area in
                   which neuroscience and robotics can fruitfully
                   interact. In this article, I will review research
                   carried out on locomotor central pattern generators
                   (CPGs), i.e. neural circuits capable of producing
                   coordinated patterns of high-dimensional rhythmic
                   output signals while receiving only simple,
                   low-dimensional, input signals. The review will first
                   cover neurobiological observations concerning
                   locomotor CPGs and their numerical modelling, with a
                   special focus on vertebrates. It will then cover how
                   CPG models implemented as neural networks or systems
                   of coupled oscillators can be used in robotics for
                   controlling the locomotion of articulated robots. The
                   review also presents how robots can be used as
                   scientific tools to obtain a better understanding of
                   the functioning of biological CPGs. Finally, various
                   methods for designing CPGs to control specific modes
                   of locomotion will be briefly reviewed. In this
                   process, I will discuss different types of CPG
                   models, the pros and cons of using CPGs with robots,
                   and the pros and cons of using robots as scientific
                   tools. Open research topics both in biology and in
                   robotics will also be discussed.},

@article{2917079,
	Abstract = {Embodiment has led to a revolution in robotics by not
                   thinking of the robot body and its controller as two
                   separate units, but by taking into account the
                   interaction of the body with its environment. By
                   investigating the impact of the body on the overall
                   control-computation, it has been suggested that the
                   body is effectively performing computations, leading
                   to the term Morphological Computation. Recent work
                   has linked this to the field of Reservoir Computing,
                   allowing to endow morphologies with a theory of
                   universal computation. In this work, we study a
                   family of highly dynamic body structures,
                   specifically tensegrity structures, controlled by one
                   of the simplest kinds of "brains". These structures
                   can be used to model biomechanical systems at
                   different scales. By analyzing this extreme
                   instantiation of compliant structures, we demonstrate
                   the existence of a spectrum of choices on how to
                   implement control in the body-brain composite. We
                   show that tensegrity structures can maintain complex
                   gaits with linear feedback control and that external
                   feedback can intrinsically be integrated in the
                   control loop. The various linear learning rules we
                   consider, differ in biological plausibility and no
                   specific assumptions are made on how to implement the
                   feedback in a physical system.},
