\section{Tensegrity Structures}
It is possible to design free-standing structures with axially loaded compression elements in a well crafted network of tensional elements.
Such an arrangement is called a tensegrity structure (tensile integrity). 
Each element of the structure experiences either pure axial compression or pure tension \cite{BuckminsterFuller1975}\cite{Snelson1965}.
The absence of bending or shear forces allows for highly efficient use of materials, 
resulting in lightweight, yet robust systems.

Because the struts are not directly connected, 
tensegrities have the unique property that externally applied forces distribute through the structure via multiple load paths. 
This creates a soft structure, for a soft robot, out of inherently rigid materials.
Since there are no rigid connections within the structure, there are also no lever arms to magnify forces. 
The result is a global level of robustness and tolerance to forces applied from any direction.

%Tensegrity structures are composed of axially loaded compression elements encompassed within a network of tensional elements, and thus each 
%element experiences either pure linear compression or pure tension.  As a result, individual elements can be extremely lightweight as there are no 
%bending or shear forces that must be resisted.  Because the struts are not directly connected, a unique property of tensegrity structures is how externally applied forces distribute through the structure 
%via multiple load paths, creating a system level robustness and tolerance to forces applied from any direction.  
%Because there are no rigid connections within the structure, there are also no lever arms to magnify forces.  Instead, all experienced forces act linearly on each structural element.  Combined with the ability to diffuse forces globally, 
This makes tensegrity robots inherently compliant and extremely well suited for physical interactions with complex and poorly modeled natural environments.  
Active motion in tensegrity robots can be performed by changing cable lengths in parallel, 
enabling the use of many small actuators that work together, rather than individual heavy actuators which work in series.  
There are also many indications that tensegrity properties are prevalent throughout biological systems, 
and the morphology of the SUPERball that we are studying, 
especially when carrying a payload, 
ends up bearing a striking resemblance to the nucleated tensegrity model of cell structure~\cite{Wang2009}\cite{Wang2001}.

\section{Prior Work in Tensegrity Robotics Design}
An important advantage of tensegrity structures with respect to general pin-jointed structures is their increased mass-efficiency due to a high fraction of tensile members.
Tensile members are generally more mass-efficient as they do not need to resist buckling.
A further advantage from a robotics perspective is that forces diffuse in a tensegrity.
There are no lever arms and torques do not accumulate at the joints as in a classic serial manipulator.
Forces distribute through multiple load paths, thus increasing robustness and tolerance to mechanical failure.

%advantages
%applications
The static properties of tensegrities have been thoroughly studied and some basic analysis is discussed in section \ref{modeling}.
On the other hand, few examples are known of truly dynamic motion of these structures.
Early examples of kinematic motion include the work at EPFL's IMAC laboratory~\cite{Fest2004}.
Skelton and Sultan introduced algorithms for the positioning of tensegrity based telescopes and the dynamic control of a tensegrity flight simulator platform~\cite{sultan2000tensegrity}.
Although there were some early efforts at MIT's CSAIL lab, it wasn't until the work of Paul and Lipson at Cornell University that the concept of tensegrity robotics became widespread~\cite{Paul2006a}.
Paul and Lipson were the first to study the properties of dynamic tensegrity structures in hardware and simulation.
A few years later Fivat and Lipson designed the IcoTens, a small actuated tensegrity icosahedron robot, but did not publish results.
In recent years, the BIER lab at the University of Virginia has been studying Central Pattern Generator based control for tensegrity based fish tails,
which is closely related to the control architectures proposed for SUPERball~\cite{Caluwaerts2013rsif,Bliss2012}.
Mirats-Tur has presented design and controls work on various other tensegrity morphologies that have been tethered or fixed to the ground~\cite{GraellsRovira2009,miratstur2011athree-dof}.
At Union College, Rieffel and colleagues are following an interesting line of work by considering vibration based actuation for small tensegrities~\cite{khazanov2014developing}.
Related work was presented by B\"ohm and Zimmermann, who demonstrated controlled locomotion of vibration driven tensegrity robots with a single actuator~\cite{bohm2013vibration}.
Finally, Shibata, Hirai and colleagues have developed pneumatically actuated rolling tensegrity structures~\cite{Shibata2009}. 
%goal

Building upon these works, the \SB{} project seeks to push forward the tensegrity robotics field and develop truly untethered, highly dynamic and compliant robots exploiting the aforementioned advantages.

\section{Tensegrity Robotics for Space Exploration}
%NASA is supporting research into tensegrity robotics to create robots with many of the same qualities that benefit biological systems.  
The high strength-to-weight ratio of tensegrity structures is very attractive due to the impact of mass on mission launch costs. 
Large tensegrity structures have been shown to be deployable from small compact configurations which enable them to fit into space constrained launch fairings.   
While the above qualities have inspired studies of deployable antennae and other large space structures~\cite{Tibert2002}, 
it is in the realm of planetary exploration that we see the most significant role for many of the unique force distribution qualities of tensegrity robots.  
The project formally funded by the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program~\cite{NIACfinalreport} and currently NASA's Ground Changing Development (GCD) is funding this research to specifically study landing and surface mobility of tensegrities,
exploiting the controllable compliance and force distribution properties which make for reliable and robust environmental interactions.  

The main goal is to develop tensegrity probes with an actively controllable tensile network
 to enable compact stowage for launch, followed by deployment in preparation for landing. 
Due to their natural compliance and 
structural force distribution properties, tensegrity probes can safely absorb 
significant impact forces, enabling high speed Entry, Descent, and Landing 
(EDL) scenarios where the probe itself acts much like an airbag.  However, 
unlike an airbag which must be discarded after a single use, the tensegrity 
probe can actively control its shape to provide compliant rolling mobility 
while still maintaining the ability to safely absorb impact shocks that might 
occur during exploration.  This combination of functions from a single 
structure enables compact and lightweight planetary exploration missions 
with the capabilities of traditional wheeled rovers, but with a mass and 
cost similar or less than a stationary probe.   

Therefore, a large fraction of the overall weight (as measured at atmospheric entry) of a tensegrity mission can be used for the scientific payload 
due to the dual use of the structure as a lander and a rover. 
This allows for cheaper missions and enables new forms of surface exploration that utilize the natural tolerance to impacts of tensegrities~\cite{Vytas_IPPW_2013}.

\subsection{Artificial Neural Networks}
\label{sec:ann}
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a theoretical group of mathematical models loosely based on neural networks found in biology that can estimate usually unknown functions which map multiple inputs to a set of outputs.
An ANN is comprised of a large set of simple functions grouped into different layers that define a mapping function \(f:X \to Y\) where \(X\) is the input set and \(Y\) is the output set.
In practice, layers are grouped into three main layers defined as 1) the Input layer, 2) the Hidden layer, and 3) the Output layer.
The Input and Output layers transfer data to and from the Hidden layer, respectively.
The Hidden layer can be comprised of one ore more sub-layers and is where the input data is converted to the output data.
Each sub-layer of the Hidden layer is comprised of a defined number of simple functions \(H_{i}\) for \(i \in n\), where \(n\) is total number of functions in a sub-layer.
Changing how each function \(h \in H\) is connected to other functions, by the use of weights, allows for the ANN to map its inputs to a desired output~\cite{lippmann1987introduction}. For our application, machine learning is used to estimate the connection weights through the use of a cost function.
The cost function is an equation which measures the success of the learning process against a user defined parameter or set of parameters.
%The cost function is an equation which measures how close to a user defined goal an iteration during the learning process was able to achieve.

\subsubsection{ANN for Locomotion}
Robotic learning methods have previously produced successful policies for tasks
such as locomotion for walking robots and
quadrupeds~\cite{tzs-spgrl-04,kp-pgrlf-04,cspd-bolg-15,kn-ldquad-11,kbps-temp-09}.
These methods, however, typically require hand-engineered policy classes, such
as a linear function approximator using a set of hand-designed features as
input~\cite{tzs-spgrl-04}.  For many tensegrity systems, it is difficult to
design suitable policy classes, since the structure of a successful locomotion
strategy might be highly complex. 
% We illustrate this in
% Section~\ref{sec:results}, by demonstrating that it is desirable to have a
% representation that is closed-loop, since open-loop control, though simpler to
% design and implement, does not generalize as well to changes in terrain,
% gravity, and other environmental and robot parameters.

Some more recent methods learn deep neural network policies that are successful
for tasks such as grasping with robotic arms and bipedal
locomotion~\cite{slmja-trpo-15,lhphe-ccdrl-16}, and such policies are more
expressive and require less hand-engineering compared to policy classes used in
previous methods. One such method, which is used in this work in section~\ref{sec:mdgps}, is mirror
descent guided policy search (MDGPS), an algorithm that frames
the guided policy search (GPS) alternating optimization framework as approximate
mirror descent~\cite{ml-gpsam-16}. MDGPS is was chosen for this work because it allows
for deep neural network policies to be learned while maintaining sample efficiency,
and it presents a natural extension to periodic locomotion tasks.

A key problem for locomotion tasks is the difficulty of establishing stable
periodic gaits, and this is exacerbated for tensegrity robots due to their
complex dynamics and unusual control mechanisms.
Near-stable behavior with even small inaccuracies can lead to compounding errors
over time, and will not be successful in producing a continuous periodic gait.
Previous algorithms have dealt with this problem by establishing periodicity
directly through the choice of policy
class~\cite{kp-pgrlf-04,gpw-fbwrc-06,emmnc-cpg-08}, utilizing a large number of
samples~\cite{slmja-trpo-15}, or initializing from
demonstrations~\cite{lk-gps-13,la-lnnpg-14}. Instead, this challenge is handled
by sequentially training several simple policies that demonstrate good behavior
from a wide range of states, and then learning a policy that reproduces the gait
of all of the sequential policies for a successful periodic behavior. The
resulting algorithm learns policies from scratch for robotic tasks that exhibit
periodicity over long time horizons. 
Section~\ref{sec:mdgps} demonstrates through experimentation that
a single learned policy for a tensegrity robot is capable of efficient,
continuous locomotion in a range of different conditions by learning appropriate
feedbacks from the robot's onboard sensors.

\subsection{Path Planning Through a Sampling-Based Motion Planner}
\label{sec:belief}

Recently, Littlefield \etal~\cite{littlefieldintegrating} implemented a high level sampling-based motion planner on a simulated \SB{} robot in the NASA Tensegrity Robotics Toolkit (NTRT), explained in chapter~\ref{modeling}.
This method, based on a kinodynamic planner published by Yanbo \etal~\cite{li2016asymptotically}, is able to converge to an asymptotically optimal solution on dynamic systems using only forward propagation and uses a novel parallel implementation to make the forward propagation step more computationally feasible.
The whole process is done within the NTRT simulation environment, where each parallel process is a NTRT simulation of \SB{}.
Figure~\ref{fig:particles} shows a visual representation of two forward propagation steps with their respective uncertainty shown as overlaid transparent robots.

\end{figure}

The main control method for this process has been a random sample of individual low level motor commands to produce the desired motion.
It has been shown with full actuation on the simulated \SB{} that path following over various terrains and obstacles are achievable with this method.
However, this process only learns a set of open loop actions based on the simulation environment and requires \(20\)+ processing cores to have reasonable computation times.

% \subsection{Central Pattern Generators}
% \label{sec:CPG_overview}
% Central Pattern Generators, or CPGs, are a set of two or more rhythmic processes connected such that each output interacts with the other process(es) to sequentially decrease and increase each process' output.
% The benefit of such a network for rhythmic generators is that, once started, the network will have a series of rhythmic outputs that are phase offset from each other with no need for any external sensory input.
% Discovered over a hundred years ago~\cite{brown1911intrinsic} and formally observed and named in the early 1960's~\cite{wilson1961central}, CPGs have linked to many rhythmic biological systems e.g. vertebrate walking~\cite{brown1911intrinsic,grillner2006biological} and involuntary movements~\cite{janczewski2006distinct,robertson1981oscillatory}.


% Because  of  the  limited  research  into  actuated  tensegrity
% robotics,   many   design   aspects   have   yet   to   be   carefully
% studied. To date, the majority of constructed tensegrity robots
% have  been  simple  prototypes  using  servo  motors,  limited
% sensing,  and  are  often  tethered  for  power  and  control  [5].
% Others have had fewer limbs than the SUPER ball, or have
% been  secured  to  the  ground  as  opposed  to  free-standing
% [6][7]. Some related approaches utilize tensegrity as part of a
% larger, more complicated system, but not as the primary loco-
% motion method [8]. Others have created designs that do not
% use direct cable actuation, as in the SUPER ball, but instead
% have  more  limited  forms  of  locomotion  through  vibration
% [9][10]. Finally, the most similar designs to the SUPER ball
% have not been engineered to specific design requirements nor
% have  the  advanced  sensing  framework  needed  for  controls
% testing [11]
%
% The  high  strength-to-weight  ratio  of  tensegrity  structures
% is very attractive due to the impact of mass on mission launch
% costs.  Large  tensegrity  structures  have  been  shown  to  be
% deployable from small compact configurations which enable

% and  other  large  space  structures  [12],  it  is  in  the  realm
% of  planetary  exploration  that  we  see  the  most  significant
% role  for  many  of  the  unique  force  distribution  qualities  of
% tensegrity  robots.  A  recent  NIAC  project  [13]  specifically
% studies  landing  and  surface  mobility  of  tensegrities,  ex-
% ploiting  the  controllable  compliance  and  force  distribution
% properties which make for reliable and robust environmental
% interactions.
% The   main   goal   is   to   develop   tensegrity   probes   with
% an  actively  controllable  tensile  network  to  enable  compact
% stowage  for  launch,  followed  by  deployment  in  preparation
% for  landing.  Due  to  their  natural  compliance  and  structural
% force  distribution  properties,  tensegrity  probes  can  safely
% absorb significant impact forces, enabling high speed Entry,
% Descent, and Landing (EDL) scenarios where the probe itself
% acts  much  like  an  airbag.  However,  unlike  an  airbag  which
% must  be  discarded  after  a  single  use,  the  tensegrity  probe

% utilize the natural tolerance to impacts of tensegrities [14].
%
% Buckminster Fuller [1] and the artist Kenneth Snelson [2]
% initially  explored  tensegrity  structures  in  the  1960s.  Until
% the  mid-1990s  the  majority  of  tensegrity  related  research
% was  concerned  with  form-finding  [15]  and  design  analysis
% of  static  structure  [16][17].  More  recently,  active  control
% efforts  for  tensegrities  began  to  emerge  [18],  as  well  as
% descriptions  of  the  dynamics  of  tensegrity  structures  taking
% the connectivity pattern into account [17].
% The tensegrity principle allows for compliance and multi-
% path load distribution, which is ideal for physical interaction
% with  the  environment.  However,  these  aspects  also  present
% significant  challenges  to  traditional  control  approaches.  A
% recent  review  [19]  shows  that  there  are  still  many  open
% problems in actively controlling tensegrities, especially when
% interacting  with  an  environment  during  locomotion  or  ma-
% nipulation  tasks.  Though  work  has  been  done  to  control  a
% tensegrity  to  change  into  a  specified  shape  [20],  practical
% determination  of  the  desired  shape  itself  is  an  ongoing
% challenge.  Recently,  locomotion  of  icosahedral  tensegrity
% robots  through  body  deformation  was  demonstrated  [21].
% Other work has addressed collision between rigid tensegrity
% elements during control generation [22][23].
% The  approach  taken  by  the  NASA  Dynamic  Tensegrity
% Robotics  Lab  builds  on  this  by  developing  body  defor-
% mation  control  algorithms  based  on  central  pattern  gen-
% erators  [24][25],  distributed  learning,  reservoir  computing,
% and  genetic  algorithms  [26],  instead  of  traditional  linear
% and  nonlinear  systems  approaches.  To  date,  our  approach
% has  shown  promising  results  at  productively  harnessing  the
% potential  of  complex,  compliant,  and  nonlinear  tensegrity
% structures.
