  abstract	= {To better understand the role of tensegrity structures in
		  biological systems and their application to robotics, the
		  Dynamic Tensegrity Robotics Lab at {NASA} Ames Research
		  Center, Moffett Field, {CA}, {USA}, has developed and
		  validated two software environments for the analysis,
		  simulation and design of tensegrity robots. These tools,
		  along with new control methodologies and the modular
		  hardware components developed to validate them, are
		  presented as a system for the design of actuated tensegrity
		  structures. As evidenced from their appearance in many
		  biological systems, tensegrity ('tensile¿integrity')
		  structures have unique physical properties that make them
		  ideal for interaction with uncertain environments. Yet,
		  these characteristics make design and control of
		  bioinspired tensegrity robots extremely challenging. This
		  work presents the progress our tools have made in tackling
		  the design and control challenges of spherical tensegrity
		  structures. We focus on this shape since it lends itself to
		  rolling locomotion. The results of our analyses include
		  multiple novel control approaches for mobility and terrain
		  interaction of spherical tensegrity structures that have
		  been tested in simulation. A hardware prototype of a
		  spherical six-bar tensegrity, the Reservoir Compliant
		  Tensegrity Robot, is used to empirically validate the
		  accuracy of simulation.},

		  parameters when there is a closed form relationship between
		  the response required and the control parameter. Building
		  on a previous study of an adjustable structure, this paper
		  describes geometric active control of a reusable tensegrity
		  structure that has been enlarged to five modules with
		  improved connections and is equipped with actuators.
		  Closely coupled strut and cable elements behave nonlinearly
		  (geometrically) even for small movement of the 10
		  telescopic struts. The control criterion for maintaining
		  the upper surface slope has no closed form relationship
		  with strut movement. The behavior of the structure is
		  studied under 25 load cases. A newly developed stochastic
		  search algorithm successfully identifies good control
		  commands following computation times of up to 1 h.
		  Sequential application of the commands through sets of
		  partial commands helps to avoid exceeding limits during
		  intermediate stages and adds robustness to the system.
		  Reuse of a previously calculated command reduces the
		  response time to less than 1 min. Feasible storage and
		  reuse of such commands confirm the potential for improving
		  performance during service.},

  abstract	= {The control of compliant robots is, due to their often
		  nonlinear and complex dynamics, inherently difficult. The
		  vision of morphological computation proposes to view these
		  aspects not only as problems, but rather also as parts of
		  the solution. Non-rigid body parts are not seen anymore as
		  imperfect realizations of rigid body parts, but rather as
		  potential computational resources. The applicability of
		  this vision has already been demonstrated for a variety of
		  complex robot control problems. Nevertheless, a theoretical
		  basis for understanding the capabilities and limitations of
		  morphological computation has been missing so far. We
		  present a model for morphological computation with
		  compliant bodies, where a precise mathematical
		  characterization of the potential computational
		  contribution of a complex physical body is feasible. The
		  theory suggests that complexity and nonlinearity, typically
		  unwanted properties of robots, are desired features in
		  order to provide computational power. We demonstrate that
		  simple generic models of physical bodies, based on
		  mass-spring systems, can be used to implement complex
		  nonlinear operators. By adding a simple readout (which is
		  static and linear) to the morphology such devices are able
		  to emulate complex mappings of input to output streams in
		  continuous time. Hence, by outsourcing parts of the
		  computation to the physical body, the difficult problem of
		  learning to control a complex body, could be reduced to a
		  simple and perspicuous learning task, which can not get
		  stuck in local minima of an error function.},

  abstract	= {Tensegrity structures represent a special class of tendon
		  space structures, whose members may simultaneously perform
		  the functions of strength, sensing, actuating and feedback
		  control. Thus, these structures ideally match the
		  definition of smart structures. This paper introduces the
		  concept of controllable tensegrity as a new class of smart
		  structures capable of large displacement. The kinematics
		  and nonlinear dynamics of one element of this class is
		  derived and analyzed. Pre-stressability conditions are
		  given and a particular equilibrium identified. The
		  equations of motion are then linearized about this
		  equilibrium and linear parametric models generated. These
		  are next used for controller design. For control system
		  design some of the tendons are chosen as actuators and some
		  as sensors and a family of dynamic controllers designed
		  such that the control energy is minimized while requiring
		  output variance constraints to be satisfied. Another family
		  of controllers is designed such that the output variance is
		  minimized while requiring input variance constraints to be
		  satisfied. The performances of these controllers are
		  evaluated.},

		  cell as a simple mechanical continuum, porous filament gel,
		  tensed cortical membrane, or tensegrity network that
		  maintains a stabilizing prestress through incorporation of
		  discrete structural elements that bear compression.
		  Real-time microscopic analysis of cells containing
		  GFP-labeled microtubules and associated mitochondria
		  revealed that living cells behave like discrete structures
		  composed of an interconnected network of actin
		  microfilaments and microtubules when mechanical stresses
		  are applied to cell surface integrin receptors.
		  Quantitation of cell tractional forces and cellular
		  prestress by using traction force microscopy confirmed that
		  microtubules bear compression and are responsible for a
		  significant portion of the cytoskeletal prestress that
		  determines cell shape stability under conditions in which
		  myosin light chain phosphorylation and intracellular
		  calcium remained unchanged. Quantitative measurements of
		  both static and dynamic mechanical behaviors in cells also
		  were consistent with specific a priori predictions of the
		  tensegrity model. These findings suggest that tensegrity
		  represents a unified model of cell mechanics that may help
		  to explain how mechanical behaviors emerge through
		  collective interactions among different cytoskeletal
		  filaments and extracellular adhesions in living cells.},
